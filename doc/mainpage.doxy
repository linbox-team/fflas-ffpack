/** @mainpage FFLAS-FFPACK Documentation.
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * FFLAS-FFPACK is a LGPL-2.1+ source code library for basic linear algebra operations over a finite field. It is inspired by BLAS interface (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and the LAPACK library for numerical linear algebra, and shares part of their design. Yet it differs in many aspects due to the specifities of computing over a finite field:
 *  - it is generic with respect to the finite field, so as to accomodate a large variety of field sizes and implementations;
 *  - it is a pure source code library, to be included and compiled in the user's software. Its build system is only used for tests and benchmarks.

/** @page inst Configuring and Installing FFLAS-FFPACK
 * FFLAS-FFPACK is a header-only package. Hower configuration process can be tweaked a lot.
 * Configure looks for BLAS routines and Givaro library which are both mandatory dependencies.
 * See the output of <code>./configure --help</code> for information about the LAPACK/BLAS discovering strategies.
