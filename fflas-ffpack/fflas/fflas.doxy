 *
 *  \brief The C-style wrapper of BLAS for finite field linear algebra.
 *
 *  FFLAS, Finite Field Linear Algebra Subroutines, provide basic linear
 *  algebra subroutines based on the BLAS interface. Therefore, the
 *  specifications are in C style; only the field given as a template parameter
 *  requires \p C++.
 *
 *  As much as possible, these routines use \p ATLAS/BLAS computations and
 *  achieve therefore high efficiency.
